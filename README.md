**The Little Schemer in Hy**


I've been dying to learn a lisp dialect for a while, and have been using Python for 
lots of general scripting and web dev needs for a while, so when I discovered Hy it
was a dream come true! I tried to work through The Little Schemer a few years ago, 
but never really got a Scheme interpreter figured out on my old work Windows laptop.
Hy is exactly what I needed to dive into this. 

I'll be keeping track of the functions I write for The Little Schemer (and maybe more!)
as I go on. Hope this helps someone! 

I decided to include my whole Python 3.4 virtalenv to hopefully make life easier. The 
functions are in hyLittleSchemer.hy

Implemented so far:
-------------------
*atom?*  
*null?*  
*eq?*  
*lat?*  
*member?*  
*rember*  
*firsts*
